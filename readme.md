# Facebook API Error Codes for Developers  

This list is heavily based on  

* http://www.fb-developers.info/tech/fb_dev/faq/general/gen_10.html) and 
* http://wiki.developers.facebook.com/index.php/Error_codes

*Should this stay in table format? Seems quite unbearable to keep it handled in tables. Also I didn't take into account "Generated by methods"*
